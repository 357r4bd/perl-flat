Note:

The shell script, bin/fash, is installed into /usr/local/bin;  while it provides 
for a convenient commandline interface to some of FLAT's more practical features, 
some users may not want it.  It can be SAFELY removed simply by deleting it. 

Other than the Perl module files for FLAT, not other extra scripts or utilities 
are installed.
